LaundryNow
==========

Hack Princeton - November 2013

Laundry Now is a simple way to retrofit old washers and dryers with a mobile notification and payment system. Simply attach the alert box to the washer/dryer and pull up the app on your phone. The box will measure the vibrations of the washer or dryer and the app will keep you updated on the status of your laundry! We even created a "Washing Machine Simulator" for our demo. Using a servo moter, and sereral available materials, we created a box that simulated the movements and vibrations of a washing machine. Credit is due to Ed Davis and Kevin Merlini For their hard work on this project as well!
